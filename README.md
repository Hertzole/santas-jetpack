# Santa's Jetpack
The source code and Unity project for my old game Santa's Jetpack. (slightly updated to most recent Unity version)

You can play the finished game [here](https://gamejolt.com/games/santa-s-jetpack/41725).

## ‚Ñπ About this repository
The repository contains the whole Unity project used to make Santa's Jetpack, with a few exceptions. Third party assets have been removed and all the graphics and music has changed so you can't get the *entire* game. The game is still playable however! You should be able to run it right as you open up the project.

The game itself was built in 2015 and I used Unity 5.2 originally. The code does not fully represent my current code and it has a lot of bad practices. I marked some of them with comments.

I've also added TODOs in the code for you to reimplement features, like GameJolt intergration.

## üî® How to run
1. Download the project either as a zip or clone/fork it.  
2. Open up the project in Unity. (The project is updated to Unity 2019.3 but it should work with any Unity 2018.3+.)
3. Open up the scene 'Level' located in the root Assets folder.
Now you're free to do whatever!

## ‚ùì But why?
It's been several years since the release and I like it myself when games are open source, so why not make my old games open source? I have nothing to hide with this game! It can be used as a learning experience for beginners. Also for those interested, they can see my (past) coding skills.

## üìÉ License
It's licensed under MIT. You can do basically anything you want with it. I'm just not liable if something happens to your project.
